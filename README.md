# Introduction
Simulation of the time dynamics of an atomic spin-wave, either matched or mismatched. A dephasing phenomenon is observed, due to inter-atomic, optical interactions. 
The time dynamics is computed via a first-order cumulant expansion (mean field regime), which accounts for part of the atomic (quantum) nonlinearity. In the limit of low atomic excitation, this is equivalent to the linear (classical) regime of coupled dipoles. The time evolution under this latter condition can be analogously
